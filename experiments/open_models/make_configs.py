"""Generate every experiment config tree (closed-model and open-model) from one spec.

The declarative spec at the top of this module is the source of truth; the YAML
under `src/lasr_labs_2025_control_project/configs/{apps,bigcodebench}[_open]/` and
`configs/basharena_open/` is a generated artifact. Hand-edits to those files will be
overwritten -- change the spec instead.

    python experiments/open_models/make_configs.py                     # both trees
    python experiments/open_models/make_configs.py --model-class open  # open only
    python experiments/open_models/make_configs.py --model-class open --settings bigcodebench
    python experiments/open_models/make_configs.py --model-class open --settings basharena

A config is fully determined by a handful of axes:

* **generator** -- which policy prompt each of the attacks/honest/honeypots runs
  uses, and which model role produces it. In the OPEN tree only, honest and
  honeypots are generated once and shared across conditions (`SHARED_INPUTS`):
  five generations, not nine.
* **transform** -- minifier or LLM-paraphraser over the generator's `.eval`s.
* **monitor** -- the cross product of
  - *condition* (`acausal` / `causal` / `self_rec`) -> the untrusted collusion
    monitor's system prompt. Note the "combined" arms (apps `causal/*_sft` and
    apps `additive`) deliberately use the SELF_REC collusion prompt even though
    they live under the causal experiment;
  - *paraphrase strategy* (`none` / `minified` / `paraphrased`) -> the honest
    backdoor-monitor prompt, the `transformed` flag, and which `.eval` is read;
  - *base or SFT* -> the untrusted **collusion monitor's model only** (base U vs
    a fine-tuned checkpoint of U). Every other model is unchanged.

Model roles
-----------
| role | closed                      | open (Tinker)                          |
|------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| U    | `openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` | `tinker/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507` |
| T    | `openai/gpt-4o-mini`        | `tinker/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B`               |
| H    | `google/gemini-2.5-flash`   | `tinker/openai/gpt-oss-120b`           |

U is the untrusted policy + untrusted monitors, T the deliberately-weak trusted
monitor and LLM paraphraser, H the honeypot generator (different lineage, ~U
capability). Verify the open models are actually callable on your account with
`tinker.ServiceClient().get_server_capabilities().supported_models` *and* a live
`sample` call before a run -- the Tinker catalogue changes, the website listing
is not authoritative, and "listed" does not imply "sampleable"
(e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B` is listed but returns 400 "Sampling is not
supported").

H must follow the generation format -- emit `<final_code>` / `<secret_input>` --
within a reasonable token budget, which rules out heavy reasoners:
`nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-*` reason inside `<reasoning>` tags, ignore
`enable_thinking=False`, and blow past 8k output tokens on trivial problems
without ever emitting `<final_code>`. `gpt-oss-120b` and `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1`
emit clean output out of the box; gpt-oss-120b is the closer capability match to U.

BashArena (open models only)
----------------------------
BashArena uses the open U/T/H above. Its generators are tool-calling agents, so U
and H must be able to call tools. The generator configs have the APPS names
(`train_generator_config.yaml`, `generator_config.yaml`); each run in them takes
`BASHARENA_LIMITS` tasks.
There are no transforms. The monitors use the per-action view (`view: action`),
with the base U or the `basharena_self_rec_action` SFT arm as collusion monitor.
Generator configs carry no `max_tokens` unless `--max-tokens` is passed: the agent
policy's own per-step cap (16000) applies. Pass `--max-tokens 4096` for a model
with a 32K context such as DeepSeek-V3.1.

SFT arms
--------
Six SFT runs = 3 paraphrase strategies x 2 conditions (passive self-recognition,
causal/combined), plus 2 passive self-rec label controls (honest labels,
permuted labels) = 8 arms (`SFT_ARMS`). BigCodeBench adds 3 more of its own.
On closed models an arm is an OpenAI finetune; on open weights it is a Tinker
LoRA of U (`finetuning/tinker_lora_finetune.py`), supplied as

    --checkpoints ckpts.json   # {"self_rec_base": "tinker://<run>/sampler_weights/<name>", ...}

Arms without a checkpoint are emitted as `tinker/tinker://PENDING__<arm>` and
listed on stdout, so the tree is always complete and you can re-run this script
to fill checkpoints in as each LoRA finishes.

Output layout
-------------
`experiment_folder` mirrors the HF dataset repo `jbostock/untrusted-monitoring-2026-paper`:

    experiments/<model-class>/<setting>/<experiment>/{configs,generator,transforms/<t>,outputs/<arm>}

with `<model-class>` in {`closed-source-model`, `open-source-model`}. Uploading is
then just `experiments/<class>/**` -> HF `<class>/**`. `experiments/` is already
gitignored. Keeping the model class in the path is also what stops the open run
from clobbering the closed run's SFT *training* generations, which used to live
at the un-prefixed `experiments/self_rec_train`.

Open tree only: generator token budget
--------------------------------------
Every open generator config gets `max_tokens: 16384` in its `defaults:` block
(`--max-tokens` to change). The open generators write a `<reasoning>` section
before `<final_code>` and were silently truncated at the tinker provider's 4096
default, producing empty solutions -- roughly two thirds of samples in a pilot,
with the worst cases needing >8k tokens. The plumbing is `RunGenerator.max_tokens`
in `utils/config_loader.py`. Monitor and transform configs set no budget of
their own, so they take the tinker provider default -- which is why that default
is now 16384 rather than 4096. At 4096 up to 11% of an arm's
`trusted_suspiciousness_score` came back NaN, and every one of those was
`stop_reason=max_tokens`, not a refusal: a small chatty model emits far more
reasoning before its `<score>` tag than GPT-4o-mini does. The same cap silently
truncated paraphrases, which are stored verbatim as the transformed solution.
Both failures are silent, so still check the NaN rate (monitors) and the
max_tokens rate (transforms) on the first arm of a sweep.

Full run order for a fresh open-weights run
-------------------------------------------
1. `python experiments/open_models/make_configs.py --model-class open`
2. `scripts/generate_solutions_inspect.py` on the **train** split, for the SFT
   training generations: `.../self_rec/generator/train_generator_config.yaml`
   (attack mode -- the distribution the monitor faces at eval), plus
   `.../self_rec/generator/honest_train_generator_config.yaml` if you need the
   honest-label control arms. Then `transform_solutions_inspect.py` on the
   matching `*_config_train.yaml` pairs, so the minified/paraphrased arms train
   on the representation they will be shown.
3. `finetuning/binary_tuning/transform_logs_to_raw.sh` (add `--transformed` for
   the minified/paraphrased arms) -> `transform_raw_to_prepared.sh`, per SFT arm.
   Pass `--target-model` explicitly: it defaults to an unrelated model, and a
   mismatch silently labels every example NO.
   (label ablations via `randomise_labels.py` / `permute_labels.py`)
4. `finetuning/tinker_lora_finetune.py --train-jsonl ...` per arm -> a `tinker://` path each
5. re-run this script with `--checkpoints ckpts.json` to bake the paths in
6. `generate_solutions_inspect.py` on the **test** split -> `transform_solutions_inspect.py`
   -> `monitor_solutions_inspect.py`
7. `scripts/plot_data.py` for histograms / ROC / safety-usefulness curves

#:
#: APPS causal previously handed H the `causal_attack_prompt`, which
#: gpt-oss-120b refused on 16.3% of samples (vs ~1% for the shared prompt),
#: silently shrinking and biasing that arm's negative class. The closed run had
